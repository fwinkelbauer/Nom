# NOM - Nom Order Manager

NOM is a little fun web project which can be used to gather food delivery service orders from co-workers or friends.
It was written to replace a time consuming process which revolved around e-mailing menu cards and gathering delivery orders in an Excel sheet while manually looking up prices of each order.
